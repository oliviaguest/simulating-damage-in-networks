To run the model, compile it (you'll need GTK+ 2). The model can
either learn weights for the network or load them from a file. (As at March,
2017, the learning algorithm is incomplete and so loading weights from a file is
preferred.) Many weight files, generated by the PDPTool implementation of the
hub and spoke model, are available in the DataFiles folders. Once loaded (or
once a folder of weights is selected), the pattern set and model behaviour can
be explored from the various tabs.

## Installation
To run the model it first needs to be compiled (once) using [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org):
```bash
make all
```

## Run
Then, run the command below to launch the GUI:
```bash
./xhub
```
