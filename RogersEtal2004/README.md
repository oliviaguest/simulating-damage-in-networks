# Rogers et al. (2004)

This folder contains code for exploring the effects of damage on the hub and spoke model. To run the model, compile it (you'll need GTK+ 2). The model can either learn weights for the network or load them from a file. (As at March, 2017, the learning algorithm is incomplete and so loading weights from a file is preferred.) Many weight files, generated by the PDPTool implementation of the hub and spoke model, are available in the DataFiles folders. Once loaded (or once a folder of weights is selected), the pattern set and model behaviour can be explored from the various tabs.

## To run
To run the model it first needs to be compiled (once) using [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org): 
```
make all
```

Then, run the command below to launch the GUI:
```
./xhub
```
