This folder contains code for exploring the effects of damage on the hub and
spoke model. To run the model, compile it (you'll need GTK+ 2). The model can
either learn weights for the network or load them from a file. (As at March,
2017, the learning algorithm is incomplete and so loading weights from a file
is preferred.) Many weight files, generated by the PDPTool implementation of
the hub and spoke model, are available in the DataFiles folders.

Once loaded (or once a folder of weights is selected), the pattern set and
model behaviour can be explored from the various tabs.
