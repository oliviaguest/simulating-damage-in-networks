## Installation
To run the model it first needs to be compiled (once) using
[gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org):
```bash
make all
```

## Run
Then, run the command below to launch the GUI:
```bash
./xbp
```

## GUI
To explore the model's behaviour it first needs to be trained. Open the "Train" tab and train it for at least 5000 epochs (but ideally 20,000, as in the original work). See screenshots below that highlight in red what to take notice of and where to click.

 Then explore the model's response to damage by, for example, switching to the "BP Analyses" tab and selecting one of those analyses. In most cases, these analyses takes the currently trained network and allows exploration of its behaviour according to one of the analyses from the original (i.e., 2004) publication, or with alternative forms of damage. In some cases, however, the code uses saved weights to generate lesion results. In these cases (e.g., for survival plots), the code loads 12 different sets of saved weights, runs the specified analysis on each of the 12 networks with those weights, and then presents average results.

The implementation includes three sets of analysis tabs, each with separate sub-analyses. One set of analysis (BP Analyses) corresponds to those reported by Botvinick and Plaut (2004). A second set (CS Analyses) corresponds to those reported by Cooper and Shallice (2006). The final set (JB Analyses) relate to a set of exploratory analyses motivated by the work of Jeff Bowers.
