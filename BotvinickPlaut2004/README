This is an implementation of the Botvinick and Plaut (2004) SRN model
of routine action selection and its disorders. To explore the model's
behaviour it first needs to be trained. Open the "Train" tab and train
it for at least 5000 epochs (but ideally 20,000, as in the original
work). Then explore the model's response to damage by, for example,
switching to the "BP Analyses" tab and selecting one of those
analyses. Each of these analyses takes the currently trained network
and explores its behaviour according to one of the analyses from the
original (i.e., 2004) publication, or with alternative forms of
damage.
